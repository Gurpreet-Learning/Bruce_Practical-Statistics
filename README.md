# "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists"
###### Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce. [O'Reilly.] May 2017

O'Reilly has pages for the [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048992.do) and its [errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920048992). GoogleBooks appears to have a large part of the [book](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JtPTDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false). (I have the print version)

_"Statistical methods are a key part of of data science, yet very few data scientists have any formal statistics training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. This practical guide explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not."_

_"With this book, you’ll learn : "_

* Why **exploratory data analysis** is a key preliminary step in data science
* How **random sampling** can reduce bias and yield a higher quality dataset, even with big data
* How the principles of **experimental design** yield definitive answers to questions
* How to use **regression** to estimate outcomes and detect anomalies
* Key **classification** techniques for predicting which categories a record belongs to
* Statistical **machine learning** methods that “learn” from data
* **Unsupervised learning** methods for extracting meaning from unlabeled data
